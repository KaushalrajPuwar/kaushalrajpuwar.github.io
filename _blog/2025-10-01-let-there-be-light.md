Hello there!  
Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student in Computer Science, and this is my very first blog post here. Iâ€™ll be using this space to share my progress, projects, and thoughts as I grow as a developer.

Right now, Iâ€™m experimenting with **Docker**, **ROS2** and **AWS**. Over time, I also plan to learn more about **machine learning** and other technologies and concepts. My goal is to document the journey, share what I build, and (hopefully) look back later to see how far Iâ€™ve come. I am still not sure about the frequency of these posts but I will try posting weekly.  

To the deveopler reading this, thanks for stopping by â€” more updates soon! ðŸš€
